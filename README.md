# 🧠 Brain Visualizer

A lightweight, interactive SVG-based brain region visualizer built with React + Tailwind CSS. Designed to be simple, informative, and visually engaging—ideal for neuroscience education, demos, and future extensions like brain simulations.

# Features

- Interactive brain SVG with hover and click functionality
- Real-time display of brain region names and descriptions
- SVG overlay with region-specific hotzones

# Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

2. Install dependencies
npm install
3. Run the app locally
npm run dev
4. Build for production
npm run build

🔧 Known Issues / Improvements
⚠️ Hotzones may appear slightly misaligned on some screen sizes.
We're working on refining the <path> elements and adjusting scaling logic to improve accuracy.

🧠 Future Directions
We plan to gradually expand this project into a more complete interactive neuroscience toolkit, including:

🔬 Neuron Simulator
A canvas- or SVG-based simulator to illustrate basic principles of neuronal electrical activity:
Action potentials
Ion channel behavior
Spike trains and thresholds
Membrane potential dynamics

🧪 Neurotransmitter Knowledge Graph
An interactive network graph showing neurotransmitters, their receptors, roles, and associated brain systems:
Nodes: Dopamine, GABA, Serotonin, etc.
Edges: Interactions, effects, medical relevance
